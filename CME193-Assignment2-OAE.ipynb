There can be many reasons why the warmer winters might affect the the CO2 levels, including complicated biological reasons such as change in vegetation cover etc, but also man-made reasons such as decreased energy conumption due to reduction in requirement of internal heating. We will use a dataset for the Ocean Nino Index (ONI) which has monthly values just like the CO2 dataset.\n",
